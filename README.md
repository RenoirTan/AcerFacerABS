# AcerFacerABS
Files for building and installing JafarAkhondali's Acer RGB keyboard kernel
module and utilities using the
[Arch Build System](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Build_System).

Check out JafarAkhondali's
[github repository](https://github.com/JafarAkhondali/acer-predator-turbo-and-rgb-keyboard-linux-module)
that this package relies on.

I'm not putting this package on the Arch User Repository because I'm not sure
if I can manage this package. However, if you want to upload this package to the
AUR, I won't stop you, but make sure proper credit is given and all licenses
and copyright are retained.
